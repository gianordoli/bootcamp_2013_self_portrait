**Idea/concept**
A gallery of self- portraits of the incoming MFA DT students. Users could draw themselves using an online tool and submit a short description.
The main goal was to build a sort of subjective profile page, instead of the standard picture-data-link.
The website utilizes html5 canvas and javaScript for the drawing part and php to store the files in a server.
